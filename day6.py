# the code is about different of data types
# ues of type() function. this function tell us the data type of a variable

a = 6
b = "Rejwan"
c = 5.44
d = True

print("the type of a is: ", type(a))
print("the type of b is: ", type(b))
print("the type of c is: ", type(c))
print("the type of d is: ", type(d))

# new data types for me
# 1. list ------- kind of array
# 2. tuple ------ its kind of array but it's data can't be change means it is immutable. can be identify (). it use first brackets
# 3. dictionary -------- we call it in javascript object. But here in python we called it dictionary it's operations are same like object.

# array

r = [2, 4, 5, 6]


# tuple

t = ("j1", "j2", "j3", "jack jack")

# dictionary

s = {"name": "Rejwan", "age": 22, "python start date": 2, "successful": True}
