# array is python

names = ['rahi', 'raisa','maruf', 'rabbi','elite']

print(names[-3])

# what the code is doing we can break it down into 2 stapes
# 1. we need to first get the length of the list or array
# 2. then we need to subtract the negative index from the length of the array
# bellow I am explaining the code 

print(names[len(names)-3])
